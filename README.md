# Anchor-OS
Anchor OS is an immutable Linux base with disposable execution environments (“rooms”). The base never mutates at runtime. All user activity runs in isolated rooms that can be destroyed and recreated safely. Compromise is contained, persistence is explicit, updates are atomic, and recovery is automatic by design.
