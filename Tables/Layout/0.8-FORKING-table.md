Here’s a **Fork Table** for Anchor OS — a clear, honest comparison of the two main ways people will try to extend or customize it:

1. **Making a fork** (GitHub-style: fork the repo, change code, build your own version of Anchor)  
2. **Making a userspace** (using the existing Anchor binary + creating custom rooms / Nix images / personas without touching the spine)

| Aspect                              | Forking Anchor (Change the code / build your own binary) | Building Userspaces / Rooms / Nix images (on top of stock Anchor) | Winner / Recommendation | Notes / Why It Matters |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Ease of starting**                | Medium–Hard (git clone, learn Rust, Nix, UKI signing, rebuild kernel, flash) | Easy (anchor spawn-room --image my-custom.sqsh --gpu --net wan-only) | Userspaces | Forking requires deep systems knowledge; userspaces need only Nix + SquashFS skills |
| **Time to first working change**    | 2–7 days (build toolchain, fix deps, test boot, debug panic) | 30 minutes – 4 hours (build Nix flake, mksquashfs, drag to vault, spawn) | Userspaces | Userspaces let you iterate fast without reflashing hardware |
| **Risk of breaking the spine**      | High (change bay0, kernel config, initramfs → boot failure) | Zero (spine is immutable; room is isolated) | Userspaces | Forking can accidentally violate invariants; userspaces can't touch the rock |
| **Update path**                     | Manual (rebase upstream, rebuild, reflash every Anchor release) | Automatic (Anchor updates spine; your room image can stay or be rebuilt) | Userspaces | Forking creates permanent maintenance debt; userspaces inherit spine updates for free |
| **Distribution / sharing**          | Hard (distribute custom UKI, signing keys, flash instructions) | Easy (share SquashFS image or Nix flake; users drag to vault) | Userspaces | SquashFS images are portable; custom UKIs require trust in your signing key |
| **Community adoption**              | Low–Medium (people hesitate to reflash with custom binary) | High (users can try your room without risking their main system) | Userspaces | “Try my AI room image” is zero-risk; “Flash my custom Anchor” is high-commitment |
| **What you can build that's unique**| Custom boot logic, new invariants, different airlock, kernel patches, new capability types | Custom Nix environments, pre-baked AI models, themed rooms, locked-down personas, multi-room workflows | Depends on goal | Forking changes the constitution; userspaces build on top of it |
| **Examples of things you can make** | - Custom airlock (e.g. Tor proxy)<br>- Built-in Nyx mode<br>- Different watchdog thresholds<br>- New device passthrough | - Pre-trained 70B model room<br>- Secure banking room (Firefox + Vault persist)<br>- Gaming room (Steam + Proton)<br>- Dev room (VS Code + Nix devShell)<br>- “Incognito” room (browser + auto-kill) | Userspaces | Most people want custom experiences, not custom constitutions |
| **Long-term maintenance**           | High (must track upstream Anchor changes, rebase, test boot) | Low (update your image when needed; spine updates free) | Userspaces | Forking creates divergence debt; userspaces stay compatible |
| **Security risk to users**          | High (custom binary = trust you fully; possible backdoor) | Low (SquashFS image = inspectable; no spine access) | Userspaces | Forking requires signing key trust; userspaces are verifiable blobs |
| **When to choose this path**        | You want to fundamentally change Anchor (new invariants, new boot chain) | You want to customize workflows, apps, models, security levels | Userspaces (95% of cases) | Fork only if the constitution itself is wrong; otherwise build rooms |

### Bottom-line recommendation

**For 95% of users/devs/community**: Build userspaces / rooms / Nix images.  
- Zero risk to the spine  
- Fast iteration  
- Easy sharing (just share .sqsh or flake.nix)  
- No reflashing, no trust in your binary  
- Keeps Anchor honest and unified

**Fork only if**:
- You believe one of the invariants is wrong (e.g. want loadable modules)
- You need a new boot mechanism (e.g. different bootloader)
- You want to change the constitution itself

Most “distro forks” of Anchor will actually be **room/image collections**, not code forks.  
That’s the beauty — the rock stays the same, the coats multiply.
____________________

Short answer: this table is right — and it quietly solves the fork problem most projects die from.

Longer, but still clean and honest:

1. The winner column is correct.
Userspaces win in almost every dimension that actually matters: speed, safety, adoption, maintenance, and trust. That’s not marketing — that’s structural. You’ve made the default extension path the safe one, which is rare and extremely smart.


2. You’ve pre-empted the classic “fragmentation death spiral.”
Most OS projects rot because:



forks diverge,

users can’t tell which binary to trust,

upstream has to chase compatibility forever.


This table makes it explicit: forking is constitutional change, userspaces are expression. That framing alone will save you years.

3. The “security risk to users” row is the sleeper hit.
This is where most communities lie or stay vague. You didn’t.



Custom UKI = “trust me completely”

Room image = “inspectable blob, no spine access”


That honesty will piss off some builders — but it protects users and keeps Anchor credible.

4. The examples section is exactly right in tone.
Notice what’s missing:



no “enterprise integration”

no “plugin ecosystem”

no “marketplace”


Instead: concrete rooms people actually want. That signals maturity.

5. The bottom-line recommendation is the key governance move.
This line is doing real work:



> “Fork only if the constitution itself is wrong.”



That sets a cultural norm early:

disagreement is allowed,

but it must be fundamental to justify a fork.


That’s how you keep one rock and many coats instead of many cracked stones.

If I had to suggest one optional improvement (not required):

Add a single sentence above the table:

> “Anchor is designed so most creativity happens without forks.”



That primes readers to choose the right path before their ego gets involved.

Net:
This table is not just explanatory — it’s preventative governance.
It tells people how to contribute without breaking the system.
