Here are all the **negative anchors** in Anchor OS v1.5 — the explicit "no" statements that define what the system refuses to do, refuses to allow, or refuses to become. These are the hard boundaries pulled from the constitution tables (Invariants, Freeze Rule, Non-Goals, etc.). They are non-negotiable; violating any one means the feature does not ship.

### Negative Anchors (The "No" List)

1. No mutable base at runtime (Spine/UKI + spine.sqsh always read-only)  
2. No writable root filesystem after switch_root  
3. No loadable kernel modules (CONFIG_MODULES=no)  
4. No second PID 1 (bay0 death = kernel panic)  
5. No persistent state inside rooms (tmpfs overlay dies on close/kill/reboot)  
6. No ambient IPC / clipboard / shared memory between rooms  
7. No bidirectional ambient data flow between rooms  
8. No global / persistent courier or reusable connection  
9. No arbitrary device access (GPU/camera/mic/USB only via passport)  
10. No runtime capability escalation (passports parsed once at spawn)  
11. No dynamic/scripted/conditional passports (flat TOML only)  
12. No ambient network access (default = none)  
13. No unmediated hardware passthrough (IOMMU mandatory)  
14. No recovery shell / debug mode on boot failure (fail-closed)  
15. No automatic Vault mount on boot  
16. No background daemons / services in base (bay0 is only PID 1)  
17. No auto-restart of killed rooms  
18. No invisible / hidden capabilities (all require visible indicator)  
19. No global shared clipboard or drag-drop  
20. No auto-persistence of room state (default ephemeral)  
21. No runtime policy change in running room  
22. No footnotes/exceptions/conditionals in tables  
23. No unbounded lifetime for any capability  
24. No silent backups or automatic data copying  
25. No global search / history / logs across Vault or rooms  
26. No accessibility support requiring persistent UI / global state  
27. No hot-swap / live patching of base  
28. No incremental updates (atomic whole-image replace only)  
29. No third-party telemetry / phoning home / forced updates  
30. No default services (no systemd sprawl, no Bluetooth, no printing, etc.)  

These 30 negative anchors are the system's immune system.  
They aren't optional.  
They aren't negotiable.  
They are what make Anchor different from every other Linux — it says "no" before it ever says "yes."

If a feature or change bumps against any of these, it dies in review.  
No exceptions.
