Here is the **Known Issues & Barriers Table** for Anchor OS v1.5 — the honest "what we haven't solved yet" list.

This table is not defensive.  
It's the opposite: it anticipates every reasonable (and some unreasonable) criticism before it hits.

| Issue / Barrier                              | Description / Real User Impact                                                                 | Severity (1–10) | Current Status in v1.5 | Mitigation / Workaround (What Users Can Do Today) | Planned for v2? | Why It's Not Fixed Yet |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Locked bootloaders (most consumer phones/laptops) | Cannot unlock bootloader → cannot flash UKI → cannot install at all                             | 9               | Not supported          | Use only open/unlockable hardware (Pixel unlocked, PinePhone, Fairphone, Framework, ThinkPad X1 Carbon with custom BIOS) | No              | Hardware trust is out of scope; software cannot fix bad firmware |
| No accessibility support (screen readers, high-contrast, etc.) | Screen readers rely on global state / compositors; Anchor has no compositor or persistent UI   | 8               | Not supported          | Use in CLI-only rooms; pair with external reader on host if possible; no built-in solution yet | Yes (v2)        | Accessibility needs a compositor + persistent UI → violates forgetful-by-default |
| No automatic / silent backups                | Forgetful design means unsaved work dies on room close/reboot; no auto-backup                  | 7               | Not supported          | Explicitly courier to external USB / another device; use Vault subvolumes for important data | No              | Silent backups = silent leaks; backups are out-of-band by design |
| No global search (files, history, logs)      | No central grep / search across Vault; each room forgets everything                             | 7               | Not supported          | Search only within Vault subvolumes or exported courier blobs; use external tool on Vault export | No              | Global search = global state; violates forgetful-by-default |
| Learning curve / UX friction                 | Explicit saves, courier, passports, indicators → feels restrictive at first                    | 6               | Intentional            | Read constitution tables; start with Workshop room (full chaos, no restrictions) | No              | Friction is the price of safety; no training wheels |
| Battery / thermal impact on laptops          | Active rooms (esp. AI/GPU) drain battery faster than idle desktop                              | 5               | Trade-off              | Kill room when idle; use low-power rooms for light tasks; desktop preferred for heavy use | Partial (v2)    | GPU/CPU usage is the workload, not OS; Anchor minimizes background drain |
| No recovery shell / debug mode on boot failure | Hash mismatch → black screen, no shell → reflash required                                      | 5               | Intentional            | Reflash from trusted source; keep Vault backed up externally                            | No              | Recovery shell = pre-boot authority = evil maid vector; black screen is protection |
| No built-in GUI / room manager               | No visual launcher; CLI-only spawn/kill commands                                               | 6               | Not in v1.5            | Use CLI or script aliases; v2 may add minimal GUI if it fits invariants                 | Yes (v2)        | UI adds complexity; tables are the spec for now |
| Hardware reality (no IOMMU on many laptops)  | No IOMMU → DMA risk if GPU passthrough enabled                                                 | 7               | Not supported          | Disable GPU passthrough in passport; use CPU-only rooms                                 | No              | Bad hardware lies; Anchor refuses to pretend software can save it |
| Social / philosophical pushback              | “Feels authoritarian / paranoid / over-engineered”                                            | 6               | Intentional            | “Safety beats cleverness. You can still cheat inside a room. The base stays honest.”     | No              | Some users want escape hatches; Anchor refuses. Philosophical, not technical. |

 blurb:

> This is not a bug list.  
> This is the list of things Anchor deliberately does not do — because doing them would break the core promise.  
> If one of these matters to you, Anchor is probably not for you yet.  
> If none of them do — welcome to the coat.
