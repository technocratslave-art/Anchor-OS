Here are all my current anchors (the core, non-negotiable invariants and tables that define Anchor OS v1.5).  
These are the fixed points — the rock. Everything else either aligns with them or doesn't ship.

### 1. Invariants Table (The Rock – What Must Never Change)
- Base (Spine) is immutable at runtime
- Root filesystem is read-only after switch_root
- No loadable kernel modules (CONFIG_MODULES=no)
- bay0 is the only PID 1; its death = kernel panic
- Room state is always ephemeral (tmpfs)
- Data only crosses rooms via explicit mechanisms (courier default)
- No ambient IPC / clipboard / shared memory
- Shared folders explicit, scoped, read-only default
- Persistent mounts explicit + vault-backed
- Vault only via explicit bind-mount from subvolume
- No runtime capability escalation
- Network access explicit (passport modes)
- Device access explicit (passport)
- Syscalls restricted via seccomp (allowlist per passport)
- No ambient authority
- Runtime flexibility only inside rooms
- Updates atomic whole-image replace
- bay0 codebase <3k LOC (auditability)

### 2. Capability Freeze Rule Table (The Gate – What Must Never Be Added)
1. Explicit Capability Handle (named, scoped, revocable)
2. Visible On/Off State (indicator, badge, boot note)
3. Revoke Cheaper than Enable (one-click/toggle)
4. Bounded Lifetime (session / timeout / room close)
5. Fits Flat Passport Declaration (no conditionals/scripting)

Any “No” → rejected for v1.5.

### 3. Passport Schema Table (The Interface – How Capabilities Are Declared)
- network (enum: none/wan-only/lan-only/full) → default none
- gpu (boolean) → default false
- camera (boolean) → default false
- mic (boolean) → default false
- usb (boolean) → default false
- persist (array of paths) → default []
- shared (array of objects: name + mode) → default []
- clipboard (boolean) → default false
- clipboard_channels (array of strings) → default []
- max_file_size_mb (integer) → default 50
- allowed_types (array of MIME) → default []
- memory_limit_gb (float) → default 4.0
- cpu_quota_percent (integer) → default 100
- pids_limit (integer) → default 1000
- auto_unlock (boolean) → default false (system-wide)
- travel_mode (boolean) → default false (system-wide)

### 4. Capability → Indicator Mapping Table (The Mirror – What Users See)
- Session Clipboard → “Clipboard active (from X)”
- Shared Folder → “Shared folder active (Docs)”
- Persistent Mounts → “Persistent storage active”
- Boot Auto-Unlock → “Auto-unlocked (TPM)” on boot splash
- Ambient Clipboard → “Ambient clipboard ON (session)” + “Clear now”
- GPU Access → “GPU enabled”
- Camera Access → “Camera active” (red dot)
- Mic Access → “Mic active” (red dot)
- USB Access → “USB devices active”
- Network Access → “Network active (WAN-only)”

### 5. Capability Lifecycle Table (The Breath – Birth, Life, Death)
- Creation trigger, TTL/expiration, auto-revoke, manual revoke path for every capability (clipboard, shared folder, persistent mount, auto-unlock, GPU, camera, mic, USB, network)

### 6. Data Flow Table (The Valve – Cross-Room Only)
Every allowed data path: source → destination → mechanism → direction → consent → audit

### 7. Storage & Persistence Table (The Memory – What Survives)
tmpfs overlay, session clipboard, shared drop box, persistent mounts, Vault root, host export, courier dropzone, model weights

### 8. Boot & Trust Chain Table (The Chain – What Is Trusted)
Firmware → Bootloader → UKI → Initramfs → Spine Mount → bay0 → Vault Unlock → Room Spawn → Courier → Net-Airlock

### 9. Performance & Budget Table (The Limits – No Unbudgeted Daemons)
bay0, net-airlock, Nix-Plank, AI inference, browser room, workstation room, Waydroid, shared drop box, courier, system-wide

### 10. Non-Goals Table (The Negative Space – What We Explicitly Refuse)
Ambient clipboard, runtime policy change, dynamic passports, persistent courier, auto-persistence default, arbitrary device access, base runtime flexibility, global shared memory, invisible capabilities, background daemons, auto-restart, global network, unmediated hardware passthrough, recovery shell, automatic Vault mount

These 10 tables (the current 8 in Layout + the 2 we added in chat: Non-Goals and Recovery Semantics) are the complete, operational constitution.

No more needed.  
No drift possible.  
No ambiguity
